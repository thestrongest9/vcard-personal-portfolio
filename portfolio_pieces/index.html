                    A good amount of my time has been spent on working out pathfinding
                    in games.

                    One of the most important (and often neglected) elements in video games is
                    pathfinding. How enemies and NPCs move relative to the player and to other 
                    points of interest greatly effects gameplay. 
                    
                    If you really think about it, most games these days are really about being
                    in the right place at the right time. Whether that be some FPS game like Apex
                    or a third-person action RPG like Dark Souls, both these games require you to
                    move (position yourself) such that your attacks can be the most effective.
                    
                    Positioning is important. Movement is important. Thus, pathfinding is too.

                <p>
                    When I started working on my most recent game (which I refer to as "Project Circle"),
                    one of the first problems I encountered was how to make enemies actually go to the player.
                    
                    Initially, when I first started the game in Unity, I tried using Unity's 2D A* implementation,
                    but found out that it did not suit my particular needs. It did not account for new obstacles 
                    in the manner I wanted and thus, I created my own A* implementation.
                    
                    During this time I figured out that working in a discrete environment was very helpful
                    for pathfinding algorithms compared to working in a continous environment. This is because
                    discrete environments allow you cut up spaces into sections that are easier to calculate
                    values for, thus making pathfinding much more easier. This is the reson why my game is
                    sectioned into grid-spaces.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    When I later moved to Godot 4.0 I initially used Godot's A* implementation. Godot's
                    built-in implementation did not use 2D navmeshes like Unity's and all I had to do was 
                    feed it grid-based positional data. This worked well enough, however, there were a lot of
                    issues.
                </p>

                            Units colliding into each other trying to reach the same grid position.

                <p>
                    Overlapping position were a big headache (that I'm not sure that I have completely solved yet).
                    In the image above you can see two units colliding into each other. The reason for this is because
                    their code tells them that they need to go to a certain tile to go down the optimal route that the
                    A* algorithm has given them. Only the problem here is that sometimes the optimal route for two units
                    contains many of the same positions. Thus, there is an issue where units "crowd" an area, making all
                    units stuck at that position. 
                </p>

                    </p>
                </center>
                <p>
                    My first solution was to have units check two things:
                    <br>
                    1) That there are no other units on the first tile it starts it's pathfinding from.
                    And also that there are no other units on the way to that starting tile. 
                    This was done via storing all Unit's current positions in a singleton and using raycasts to check
                    the first starting positions.
                    <br>
                    2) Adjust (negatively) grid values where units are stationed. Ideally this would reinforce
                    the A* algorithm to avoid positions containing other units. 
                    <br>
                    3) Recaclulate the A* path when possible.
                    <br>
                    Now this did help somewhat, and you can see in the image above that it allows
                    for multiple units to coordinate and not get stuck on each other.

                <p>
                    Even with those improvements occasionally still issues popped up. A* get the 
                    optimal path ultimately meant that it was likely that many units would share the
                    same path. The collision problem was still there then.

                    This had lead me to my most recent development: flowfield pathfinding.
                    Previously I had attempted to adjust A* in as many ways as possible to
                    account for it's collision issues. However, there are more pathfinding algorithms
                    out there other than A*. Flowfields are used in RTS games where multiple units
                    have to move together in tandem. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the above video I have implemented flowfield pathfinding within the grid. Each
                    grid cell points to the next tile that allows a moving unit to get closer to the target.
                    There are also many other small adjustments happening in the background (such as a slight
                    bias towards the center of tiles so that the moving enemy does not collide against walls.),
                    but because no matter where the enemy is located there is always a given direction it can move in.
                    Therefore, even when enemies are crowded together, they all still move in the same general
                    direction given by the tile it is closest to. This helps alleviate the crowding issue. 
                    Admittedly, it does have a larger performance cost than A* (since it needs to calculate values
                    for all tiles). But good memory management and multithreading help to lessen these problems.

                    It seems like pathfinding is a very case dependent problem with no good solutions.
                    For now, this is all I've done for my current game.

                    I've also done some 3D mesh-based pathfinding. The above video shows a 3D pathfinding algorithm with
                    that adjusts on the fly (but is very expensive). Essentially, a script checks at evenly spaced points
                    on top of the mesh with spherecasts to see if there are collisions. Then it receives all the points without
                    collisions and runs an A* algorithm on those points. Finally, it gives the path to the enemy which moves towards the player, as seen above.

                        Above was a game made in Phaser.js. It uses Javascript, HTML, and Phaser.js.
                        It's a small endless runner type of game. The spaceship sprites where created
                        using PicoCAD to obtain the pseudo-3D look. It also uses a shader to simulate
